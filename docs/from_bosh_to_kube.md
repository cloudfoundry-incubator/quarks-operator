## High-level Direction

- releases are defined in the usual way (a `releases` block), but the information given is used to build a reference for a docker image
- a release in the `releases` block can have credentials for the registry
- each instance group can be transformed to an `ExtendedStatefulSet` or an `ExtendedJob`
- each BOSH Job corresponds to a container in the pod defined in the `ExtendedStatefulSet` or the `ExtendedJob`
- `variables` are generated using `ExtendedSecrets`
- [rendering of BOSH Job Templates](rendering_templates.md) requires mounting the current version of the [Desired Manifest](desired_manifests.md) and all secrets corresponding to variables
- all communication happens through `Services`, which have deterministic DNS Addresses
- links are resolved using services

## Deployment Lifecycle

### Create

1. First, `ExtendedSecrets` are created
2. `ExtendedJobs` for template rendering are created (we wait until this is complete, because we need BPM information to move forward)
3. Volumes are created
4. `ExtendedJobs` for errands are created
5. `ExtendedStatefulSets` are created
6. `ExtendedServices` are created

### Update

> Resources are identified by their name.

1. New resources are created, in the same order as `Create`
2. An update is issued for resources that already exist
3. Any resources that are no longer needed are deleted

### Delete

As the `BOSHDeployment` is deleted, all owned resources are automatically deleted.

## Open Questions and TODOs

1. Detailed specification for dealing with AZs
2. How do we specify credentials for docker registries containing release images?
   - we could extend the deployment manifest schema (with agreement from the BOSH team)
   - we could have a special k8s secret, which by convention is always named something like `docker-registry-secrets` and contains hostnames-to-credential mappings. e.g.:
     ```
     docker.io: { user: test, password: none }
     localhost: { user: root, password, toor }
     ```
3. Are we going to use ephemeral disks? Are they useful?
4. BOSH makes use of errands, which are manually triggered. How do we support this in ExtendedJob?
5. Discuss the ability to extend the releases block with credentials.
6. Details on how we create services for jobs
7. How do we rename things?
8. Do we need ephemeral disks?
9.  For persistent disks - are they shared among container pods?
10. Canary support in ExtendedStatefulSets
11. How do we deal with volumes? How can data be migrated from an older volume? Can we use ExtendedJobs for this? Do we need `ExtendedPersistentVolumes`?
12. How are readiness probes generated?

### Calculation of docker image location for releases

The release image locations are comprised of multiple elements: the docker registry URL, the organization and repository, the stemcell name and version, the fissile version and the release name and version. Release image locations always have to be resolved in the context of an instance group/job because it depends on the stemcell that is being used.

A typical release image location looks could look like `hub.docker.com/cfcontainerization/cflinuxfs3-release:opensuse-15.0-28.g837c5b3-30.263-7.0.0_233.gde0accd0-0.62.0`.

The different elements are taken from different places in the manifest. Given this excerpt from a BOSH deployment manifest:

```yaml
stemcells:
- alias: default
  os: opensuse-42.3
  version: 28.g837c5b3-30.263-7.0.0_234.gcd7d1132
instance_groups:
- name: diego-cell
  stemcell: default
  jobs:
  - name: cflinuxfs3-rootfs-setup
    release: cflinuxfs3
releases:
- name: cflinuxfs3
  version: 0.62.0
  url: hub.docker.com/cfcontainerization
  sha1: 6466c44827c3493645ca34b084e7c21de23272b4
  stemcell:
    os: opensuse-15.0
    version: 28.g837c5b3-30.263-7.0.0_233.gde0accd0
```

the stemcell information (name, and stemcell and fissile version) are taken from the `stemcells` entry that matches the instance group's stemcell alias. The registry URL including the organization, the release name, and the version com from the `releases` entry that's referenced from the job.

*Note*: Releases can optionally specify a separate `stemcell` section, in which case the information from the instance group stemcell is overridden.

### Variables to Extended Secrets

For each **BOSH Variable**, the cf-operator creates `ExtendedSecrets`.
The `ExtendedSecret` is meant to generate the value required by the variable.

The name of the `ExtendedSecret` is calculated like this:

```
<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>.<VARIABLE_NAME>
```

The name of the final generated `Secret` (the `secretName` key) is calculated the same way.

The deployment name and variable name can only consist of lowercase alphanumeric characters, and the character `"-"`.
All `"_"` characters are replaced with `"-"`. All other non-alphanumeric characters are removed.

The secret name cannot start or end with a `"-"`. These characters are trimmed.

Secret names are also restricted to 63 characters in length, so if a generated name exceeds 63 characters, it should be recalculated as:

```
name=<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>-<VARIABLE_NAME>

<name trimmed to 31 characters><md5 hash of name>
```

### Instance Groups to Extended StatefulSets and Jobs

#### BOSH Services vs BOSH Errands

#### Naming

#### Pods

#### Mounts

- **desired manifest**
- **bosh variable secrets**
- **user configmaps** for variables that are not generated
- data volumes

#### Entrypoints

#### Mounts

## Other

These need to be provided by a mount in each container,

`/var/vcap/instance/name`
`/var/vcap/instance/id`
